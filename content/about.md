Hi there, welcome to my little corner of the web! I'm Osman Arjen, and you might also stumble across me as PyroSoft in some online spaces.

Ever since I can remember, I've been fascinated by how things work, especially in the digital realm. That curiosity led me down the path of software development and computer science, and honestly, I haven't looked back. For me, coding isn't just about logic and syntax; it's a creative outlet, a way to solve puzzles and build entirely new things from scratch.

My biggest passions within this vast field lie in game development and computer graphics. I love the challenge of creating immersive experiences, figuring out how to make pixels dance, and architecting the systems that power virtual worlds. Whether it's diving into the nitty-gritty of C++ or exploring the flexibility of Python, I'm always eager to learn and experiment.

This blog is my space to share that journey. Expect thoughts on software development, explorations into game design concepts, maybe some deep dives into graphics programming, and generally just sharing the things I find exciting in the world of computer science.

Thanks for stopping by â€“ hope you find something interesting!
